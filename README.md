A simple python script to merge X amount of Google trend CSVs into one XLSX for custom reporting.

# For Developers:
Place all necessary CSVs inside the src folder alongside `main.py` as the script will search its current directory for files to merge.

To bundle a script into an executable you must have [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) installed on your machine.
A `bundle.sh` file has been provided to autoamte the bundling process. Running `bash bundle.sh` from the root directory will begin the process to create an executable.

3. Place the `bundleScript.exe` in this same directory.
4. Double click `bundleScript.exe` to start the process.
